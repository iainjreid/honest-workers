### Information
This document is used to maintain a structured approach to planning future improvements and features.

### Active Goals
- Configuration: Enable user configuration of the Honest Workers class. This should be available at point of instantiation, and throughout the lifetime of the class instance. Adding a subset of overriding values when registering or executing tasks would also be beneficial.

### Features
- Enable overriding access to the "defaultThreads" configurable when registering or executing a task.
